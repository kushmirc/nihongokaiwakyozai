## Overview:
I created this website because there is a need among teachers of the Japanese language for practical and engaging teaching materials that they can use with their students.  Textbooks are often tedious, and non-textbook materials often do not provide learning opportunities to maximize value from lesson time.  

Learning Japanese has been a long-time hobby of mine, so I’ve naturally been interested in finding learning materials that are both fun and efficient for learning.  I’ve found that reading news articles at an appropriate level of difficulty and from a variety of interesting topics is one of the best ways to learn Japanese.  

There are plenty of apps and websites that deliver learning resources based on news articles directly to students for self-study.  However, many students enjoy being able to engage with a native speaker of the language while they learn.  There are very few resources available to Japanese teachers which enable them to have better conversational language lessons.  

I created nihongokaiwakyozai.com (Japanese Conversation Teaching Materials) to fulfill this need.  I have had positive feedback from several Japanese teachers who also see the value in these materials.  

As explained in the About Us section of the website, I’m careful to respect the legal rights of the news content creators.  The website is for educational purposes only, and has not integrated any forms of monetization.

## Details and Technical Information:
The domain registrar is GoDaddy.com, and the hosting provider is Hostinger.com.  The website is built with Wordpress, and the various functions are accomplished with a number of Wordpress plugins.   
I have made a number of manual adjustments to the HTML of the pages for fine tuning.  For example, ruby text is not handled well in a number of situations and requires direct changes to the html <ruby> tags.  

The website is primarily in Japanese, since the primary audience is native Japanese language teachers.  There are English translations to help facilitate understanding for students.  The homepage includes links to news articles organized by category, as well as direct links to recent and popular articles.  

Each article introduces vocabulary as an introduction to the lesson.  Vocabulary is followed by the article body, which can be viewed with or without the aid of ruby (phonetical) text.  The article body is then followed by a few questions that the teacher may ask the student to check for comprehension of the article content.  Finally, there are suggested discussion questions which help facilitate an engaging free-conversation session.  

Each article includes the video clip accompanying each news story.  Short videos help the stories come to life for language learners, while reinforcing vocabulary and comprehension.  In order to keep the site as lightweight as possible, the videos are stored remotely on my pCloud drive, and are streamed to the site when they’re played.
