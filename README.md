## Overview:
I created this website because there is a need among teachers of the Japanese language for practical and engaging teaching materials that they can use with their students.  Textbooks are often tedious, and non-textbook materials often do not provide learning opportunities to maximize value from lesson time.  

Learning Japanese has been a long-time hobby of mine, so I’ve naturally been interested in finding learning materials that are both fun and efficient for learning.  I’ve found that reading news articles at an appropriate level of difficulty and from a variety of interesting topics is one of the best ways to learn Japanese.  

There are plenty of apps and websites that deliver learning resources based on news articles directly to students for self-study.  However, many students enjoy being able to engage with a native speaker of the language while they learn.  There are very few resources available to Japanese teachers which enable them to have better conversational language lessons.  

I created nihongokaiwakyozai.com (Japanese Conversation Teaching Materials) to fulfill this need.  I have had positive feedback from several Japanese teachers who also see the value in these materials.
